# Doorbell
Normally, I lock myself in my room and do homework with noise cancelling headphones on but this can prove
troublesome for my roomates. Occasionally they need my attention and have struggled with no avail at banging on my door. 
Other attempts at getting my attention include sliding paper under my door, sliding pizza boxes under my door,
calling my cell phone, messaging me on facebook yet none of these have been a good solution. 

With the new Doorbell system when my roomates click the button provided on the python server that my 
pi hosts it makes a POST request which triggers a strip of RGB LEDs that are glued to my desk to flash bright red.

Special thanks to Leo Chan for helping me get the java script working!
